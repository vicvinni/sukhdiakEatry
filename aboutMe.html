            <h2>LifeStory</h2>
            <p>I moved out of India when I was very young, since then we moved frequently due to my father getting job in a different place. due to this, I learned to become very adaptable, accepting and fell in love with meeting new people, although I hadn’t discovered these skills at that point. When we had finally settled in Leicester UK, I found a place to call home. I completed my schooling from Leicester where my teachers would usually describe me as hard working, committed and determined. I have studied BSc Computer Science from DeMontFort University(DMU),  Leicester, where I enjoyed diving into coding, this enjoyment led me to the decision of specialising in MSc Software Engineering. It was during my higher education where I learned of my problem solving, and  creative skills. It was there that I further developed a CAN-DO attitude and an attitude of not giving up. Other than studies I have also participated in volunteering, where, in teams of 4, we’d lead workshops to introduce elders to general Technology. I have also led classroom lessons to introduce and teach coding – Scratch – to younger children. alongside volunteering, I have also worked as a student ambassador for DMU – leading campus tours and holding coding workshops for potential students and just being the friendly face of the university in general. 
I value family time very highly, so during my free time I do enjoy spending time with loved ones, that is however not to say I don’t enjoy the outdoors. I enjoy reading books that cultivate thinking and my faith, as well as cooking- which I find satisfying!
